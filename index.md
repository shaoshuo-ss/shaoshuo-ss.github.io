## 🪪About Me

I'm Shuo Shao😄, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate with the State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University. I am hornord to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5fa4lOQAAAAJ">Zhan Qin</a> and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uuQA_rcAAAAJ">Kui Ren</a>. I also work closely with Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mSW7kU8AAAAJ">Yiming Li</a> and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bdFQARIAAAAJ">Wenyuan Yang</a>. I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Central South University in 2022, advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3odvjZ0AAAAJ">Xiyao Liu</a>.

My research interests primarily focus on **Trustworthy AI**. My previous work mainly addresses **AI Copyright and Security**, especially **LLM Copyright Auditing via Watermarking and Fingerprinting**, **Backdoor Attack and Defense**, and **Privacy Extraction Attack and Defense**. Currently, I am more focused on **LLM and Agent Safety**, particularly in the areas of **Safety Alignment** and **Red-teaming**.
