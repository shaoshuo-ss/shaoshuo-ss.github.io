## 🪪About Me

I'm Shuo Shao😄, a third-year Ph.D. student with the College of Computer Science and Technology and the State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University. I am currently advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5fa4lOQAAAAJ">Zhan Qin</a> and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uuQA_rcAAAAJ">Kui Ren</a>. I also work closely with Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mSW7kU8AAAAJ">Yiming Li</a> and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bdFQARIAAAAJ">Wenyuan Yang</a>. I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Central South University in 2022, advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3odvjZ0AAAAJ">Xiyao Liu</a>.

My research interests focus on three main aspects of trustworthy AI: copyright, security, and privacy, including

- **AI Copyright Protection**
  - Model Watermarking and Fingerprinting
  - Model Authorization and Access Control
  - Dataset Auditing
- **AI Security**
  - Backdoor Attack and Defense
  - LLM Security
- **AI Privacy**
  - Membership Inference and Data Extraction
  - Privacy-preserving Model Inference
