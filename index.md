## 🪪About Me

I'm Shuo Shao😄, a third-year Ph.D. student with the College of Computer Science and Technology and the State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University. I am currently advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5fa4lOQAAAAJ">Zhan Qin</a> and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uuQA_rcAAAAJ">Kui Ren</a>. I also work closely with Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mSW7kU8AAAAJ">Yiming Li</a> and Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bdFQARIAAAAJ">Wenyuan Yang</a>. I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Central South University in 2022, advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3odvjZ0AAAAJ">Xiyao Liu</a>.

My research interests include:

- Copyright protection in AI (model, dataset, and generated content).
- Backdoor attack and defense.
- Federated learning.
- AI security and privacy.

    <p><font color=DodgerBlue><b>Explanation as a Watermark: Towards Harmless and Multi-bit Model Ownership Verification via Watermarking Feature Attribution</b></font></p>
    <p><b>Shuo Shao</b>, Yiming Li, Hongwei Yao, Yiling He, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we propose a novel black-box model watermarking paradigm that embeds the watermark into the explanation of the model. Our paradigm can improve the harmlessness and facilitate multi-bit watermark embedding compared with existing backdoor-based method.</p>
